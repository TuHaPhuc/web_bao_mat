# Login System - Deployment Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Login System web application. The application is built with Python/Flask and uses SQLite for database storage.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A web server capable of hosting WSGI applications (for production)

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
Download the project files to your server or local machine where you want to deploy the application.

### Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Database
The database will be automatically initialized when the application is first run. It will be created in the `instance` folder.

### Step 5: Run the Application (Development)
```bash
# On Windows
python app.py

# On macOS/Linux
python3 app.py
```
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: Deploying with Gunicorn (Linux/macOS)
Install Gunicorn:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Start the application with Gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

### Option 2: Deploying with Waitress (Windows)
Install Waitress:
```bash
pip install waitress
```

Create a file named `wsgi.py` with the following content:
```python
from app import app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from waitress import serve
    serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

Run the server:
```bash
python wsgi.py
```

### Option 3: Deploying with a Web Server (Nginx/Apache)
For production environments, configure Nginx or Apache to proxy requests to your Flask application running through a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.

#### Example Nginx Configuration
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Change the secret key in production:
   - Set `app.config['SECRET_KEY']` to a secure random string in the `app.py` file.
   - Or better, set it via an environment variable.

2. Disable debug mode in production:
   - Change `app.run(debug=True)` to `app.run(debug=False)` or use a WSGI server as described above.

3. Configure HTTPS:
   - Use a reverse proxy like Nginx with SSL/TLS certificates.
   - You can obtain free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

4. Database Backup:
   - Implement a regular backup schedule for the SQLite database file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Database permissions**: Ensure that the user running the application has write permissions for the `instance` directory.

2. **Port conflicts**: If port 5000 (development) or 8000 (production examples) is already in use, change the port in the corresponding command.

3. **Virtual environment issues**: Make sure you've activated the virtual environment before running the application or installing packages.

4. **Missing dependencies**: If you encounter "module not found" errors, ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
